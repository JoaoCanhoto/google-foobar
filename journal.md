## level 1
Success! You've managed to infiltrate Commander Lambda's evil organization, and finally earned yourself an entry-level position as a Minion on her space station. From here, you just might be able to subvert her plans to use the LAMBCHOP doomsday device to destroy Bunny Planet. Problem is, Minions are the lowest of the low in the Lambda hierarchy. Better buck up and get working, or you'll never make it to the top...
* [level 1](level-1/1.0-solar-doomsday/problem.md)

>Next time Bunny HQ needs someone to infiltrate a space station to rescue prisoners, you're going to tell them to make sure 'stay up for 48 hours straight scrubbing toilets' is part of the job description. It's only fair to warn people, after all.

## level 2
You survived a week in Commander Lambda's organization, and you even managed to get yourself promoted. Hooray! Henchmen still don't have the kind of security access you'll need to take down Commander Lambda, though, so you'd better keep working. Chop chop!
* [level 2.1](level-3/3.1-the-grandest-staircase-of-them-all/problem.md)

The perks are definitely better as a Henchman than as a Minion. You're even allowed to sleep lying down!

The latest gossip in the henchman breakroom is that "LAMBCHOP" stands for "Lambda's Anti-Matter Biofuel Collision Hadron Oxidating Potentiator". You're pretty sure it runs on diesel, not biofuel, but you can at least give the commander credit for trying.

Rumor has it the prison guards are inexplicably found of bananas. You're an apple person yourself, but you file the information away for future reference. You never know when you might need to bribe a guard or three...

> Awesome! Commander Lambda was so impressed by your efforts that she's made you her personal assistant. You'll be helping her directly with her work, which means you'll have access to all of her files-including the ones on the LAMBCHOP doomsday device. This is the chance you've been waiting for. Can you use your new access to finally topple Commander Lambda's evil empire?

## level 3

There are a lot of difficult things about being undercover as Commander Lambda's personal assistant, but you have to say, the personal spa and private hot cocoa bar are pretty awesome.
* [level 3.1](level-3/3.1-the-grandest-staircase-of-them-all/problem.md)


Commander Lambda has six suits, three dress uniforms, four casual outfits, and one Dress-Uniform-For-Important-Speeches-Only. You know this because you've already had to take all of them to the dry cleaner's. Twice!
* [level 3.2](level-3/3.2-doomsday-fuel/problem.md)


As Commander Lambda's personal assistant, you get to deal with all of the paperwork involved in running a space station big enough to house the LAMBCHOP. And you thought Bunny HQ had too much bureaucracy...
* [level 3.3](level-3/3.3-queue-to-do/problem.md)

> Excellent! You've destroyed Commander Lambda's doomsday device and saved Bunny Planet! But there's one small problem: the LAMBCHOP was a wool-y important part of the space station, and when you blew it up, you triggered a chain reaction that's tearing the station apart. Can you rescue the bunny workers and escape before the entire thing explodes?


## level 4

Not all of the bunny workers are highly-trained operatives. Some of them are civilians, and they're panicking in all the noise and confusion of the space station's destruction. Several of them have wedged themselves into corners and started thumping, which isn't exactly helping the station's structural integrity...
* [level 4.1](level-4/4.1-bringing-a-gun-to-a-trainer-fight/problem.md)

For a world-destroying despot with a penchant for making space-station-sized doomsday devices, Commander Lambda sure has good taste in office furniture. As a personal assistant, you have the latest in standing desk and ergonomic chair technology, and it sure makes a difference!
* [level 4.2](level-4/4.2-running-with-bunnies/problem.md)

> Oh no! You escaped Commander Lambda's exploding space station -- but so did the Commander, and Lambda is definitely not happy with you. Lambda is chasing you in a heavily-armed starfighter, while you and the bunny workers are stuck in these lumbering escape pods. It'll take all your wits and cleverness to escape such a hare-y situation, so you'd better hop to it!

## level 5

Your planned escape route - and your backup route, and your extra-backup route - have all been blocked by debris from the space station or Commander Lambda's starfighters. Your only remaining option is to try deep space, and to boldly go where no bunny has gone before.
